Installation instructions
=========================

Dependencies
------------

TensorFlow
^^^^^^^^^^

Because TensorFlow comes in CPU-only and GPU-enabled variants, we leave
it up to the user to install the version that best fits their use case.

On most platforms, either of the following commands should properly
install TensorFlow:

::

   pip install tensorflow # CPU-only version
   pip install tensorflow-gpu # GPU-enabled version

For more detailed information, please consult the `installation
instructions of TensorFlow`_.

libsndfile (Linux only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BirdVoxClassify depends on the PySoundFile module to load audio files,
which itself depends on the non-Python library libsndfile. On Windows
and Mac OS X, these will be installed automatically via the ``pip``
package manager and you can therefore skip this step. However, on Linux,
``libsndfile`` must be installed manually via your platformâ€™s package
manager. For Debian-based distributions (such as Ubuntu), this can be
done by simply running

::

   apt-get install libsndfile

For more detailed information, please consult the `installation
instructions of pysoundfile`_.
